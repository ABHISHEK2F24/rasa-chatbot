Rasa Open Source supplies the building blocks for creating virtual assistants. Use Rasa to automate human-to-computer interactions anywhere from websites to social media platforms.

Rasa Open Source provides three main functions. 
1. **Natural Language Understanding** : Convert raw text from user messages into structured data. Parse the user’s intent and extract important key details.
2. **Dialogue Management** : Machine learning-powered dialogue management decides what the assistant should do next, based on the user’s message and context from the conversation.
3. **Integrations** : Built-in integration points for over 10 messaging channels, plus endpoints to connect with databases, APIs, and other data sources.
Together, they provide everything you need to build a virtual assistant.
